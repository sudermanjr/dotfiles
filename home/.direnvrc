# Usage: use_flox [...]
#
# Loads the environment variables from a Flox envrionment
# By default, uses the ".flox" directory to load the envrionment from
# You can also specify a remote envrionment as follows
# 
# ```
# use_flox --remote=<owner>/<name>
# ```
# or
# ```
# use_flox --trust --remote=<owner>/<name>
# ```
#
# Where <owner>/<name> is the name of the remote environment on FloxHub
#
# You can also specify another directory to load the environment from
#
# ```
# use_flox --dir=<path>
# ```
#
# Where <path> is the path to a directory containing a ".flox" directory
#
# Custom commands aren't supported, since we use the `flox activate` command to dump and load the environment
#
